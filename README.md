# Credport

This is a source dump for our failed startup [Credport](http://www.credport.org).

See our post-mortems [Tale of Credport](http://nambrot.com/posts/13-the-tale-of-credport/) and [Credport Technical Post-Mortem](http://nambrot.com/posts/14-credport-technical-post-mortem/) first.

### Get started

You should be able to run this by cloning the repo and running (if I remember correctly)

````
bundle
rake neo4j:install
rake neo4j:start
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
foreman start
````

You'd probably want to insert actual API keys to make it work though.

## Other

You can also check out the [Credport organization on Github](https://github.com/credport) to see how we our partners like [Tamyca](https://www.tamyca.de) and [Kinderfee](https://www.kinderfee.de) integrated us with our easy to use OAuth API.

You can contact me anytime @nambrot if you have any questions or problems.
